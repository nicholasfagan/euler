well, we don't need to program to do this.
we want to find the smallest number that is a multiple of numbers [1..20].

We can get the prime factorization of each of these numbers,
and get the max powers for each prime. 
then just multiply all the prime factors to their heightest power.

we can start with 2.
2 divides 16 4 times, so we ahve 2^4.
3 divides 9 twice, so 3^2
5 divides 5 once, so 5^1
7 ... etc.
we end up with
2^4*3^2*5*7*11*13*17*19
which is 
232792560


Now, lets write code to do this for us.
We need to get the prime factorization of every number from 2 to n,
and get the max powers of that list, then multiply them together.
